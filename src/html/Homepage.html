            This project involved developing a versatile quiz engine designed to support students in their degree modules.
            The quiz engine enables a variety of question types to be created and automatically graded, allowing
            students to track their progress. The system was designed and implemented with algorithms to provide relevant
            feedback. Additionally, the quiz employs a specialised algorithm to offer adaptive learning, ensuring that
            each userâ€™s unique needs are addressed.

            This algorithm that is used in this system is detailed as the following:

            <br>
            <strong>Bayes' theorem:</strong> This is based on the principle that the probability of an event can
            be updated as new evidence is presented, combining prior knowledge with new data to
            refine predictions. In this quiz, the student's knowledge level can be updated as they answer questions,
            combining prior knowledge of their abilities with their responses to refine the assessment of their understanding.
            This quiz implementation simplifies the Bayes' theorem through correct and incorrect question streaks to properly adapt the difficulty without
            erratic behaviour. (See CSC8099_Lewis Hamilton for more information)
