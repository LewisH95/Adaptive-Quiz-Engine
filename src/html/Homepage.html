            This project was to develop a generic quiz engine which could be used
            to help support students on their degree modules. The quiz engine allows a
            range of question types to be set up and automatically marked, and allow students
            to track their progress. The provision of appropriate feedback in this system was
            designed and implemented with appropriate algorithms.

            The quiz utilises two specific algorithms in order to provide adaptive learning for
            the user, to ensure that each user feels that their specific needs are being met.
            These algorithms are detailed as the following:
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Bayes' theorem:</strong> This is based on the principle that the probability of an event can
            be updated as new evidence is presented, combining prior knowledge with new data to
            refine predictions. In this quiz, the student's knowledge level can be updated as they answer questions,
            combining prior knowledge of their abilities with their responses to refine the assessment of their understanding.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Computerized Adaptive Testing:</strong> This is based on the idea that a test can adapt in real-time
            to the users ability level by selecting questions that are most appropriate for
            their estimated skill level, resulting in a more efficient and personalised assessment.
